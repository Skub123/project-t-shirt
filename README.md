# project-t-shirt
By using Python (a Jupyter notebook), PyTorch (neural style transfer), and Pillow (to copy and paste images), I finished programming my final designs for the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. *I would like to wear such t-shirts. I will print them anyways even if I will lose this competition.* See the photos! The brain with style transfer Ã  la blue digital world represents deep learning, PyTorch, and the secure cloud. Computers with PyTorch, OpenMined, and PySyft represent the secure cloud in which PyTorch computes important statistics about users while preserving our privacy, by using OpenMined and PySyft. The information flows between computers have zeros and ones (representing the binary code of computers), directions (representing bidirectional communications), and eyes (representing potential hackers lurking the Internet). ðŸ§
